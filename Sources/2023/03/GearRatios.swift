/// Day 3 : Gear Ratios
///
/// # Part One
///
/// You and the Elf eventually reach a gondola lift station; he says the
/// gondola lift will take you up to the **water source**, but this is as far
/// as he can bring you. You go inside.
///
/// It doesn't take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem:
/// they're not moving.
///
/// "Aaah!"
///
/// You turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of
/// surprise. "Sorry, I wasn't expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn't working
/// right now; it'll still be a while before I can fix it." You offer to help.
///
/// The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the
/// engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can **add up all the
/// part numbers** in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which
/// part is missing.
///
/// The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual
/// representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you
/// don't really understand, but apparently **any number adjacent to a
/// symbol**, even diagonally, is a "part number" and should be included in
/// your sum.  Periods (`.`) do not count as a symbol.
///
/// Here is an example engine schematic:
///
///```
/// 467..114..
/// ...*......
/// ..35..633.
/// ......#...
/// 617*......
/// .....+.58.
/// ..592.....
/// ......755.
/// ...$.*....
/// .664.598..
/// ```
///
/// In this schematic, two numbers are **not** part numbers because they are
/// not adjacent to a symbol: `114` (top right) and `58` (middle right). All
/// other numbers are adjacent to a symbol and so are part numbers; their sum
/// is **`4361`**.
///
/// Of course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. **What is the sum of
/// all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?**
///
/// # Part Two
///
/// The engineer finds the missing part and installs it in the engine! As the
/// engine springs to life, you jump in the closest gondola, finally ready to
/// ascend to the water source.
///
/// You don't seem to be going very fast, though. Maybe something is still
/// wrong? Fortunately, the gondola has a phone labeled "help", so you pick it
/// up and the engineer answers.
///
/// Before you can explain the situation, she suggests that you look out the
/// window. There stands the engineer, holding a phone in one hand and waving
/// with the other. You're going so slowly that you haven't even left the
/// station. You exit the gondola.
///
/// The missing part wasn't the only issue - one of the gears in the engine is
/// wrong. A **gear** is any `*` symbol that is adjacent to **exactly two part
/// numbers**. Its **gear ratio** is the result of multiplying those two
/// numbers together.
///
/// This time, you need to find the gear ratio of every gear and add them all
/// up so that the engineer can figure out which gear needs to be replaced.
///
/// Consider the above engine schematic again.  In this schematic, there are
/// **two** gears. The first is in the top left; it has part numbers
/// `467` and `35`, so its gear ratio is `16345`. The second gear is in the
/// lower right; its gear ratio is `451490`. (The `*` adjacent to 617 is not a
/// gear because it is only adjacent to one part number.) Adding up all of the
/// gear ratios produces **`467835`**.
///
/// **What is the sum of all of the gear ratios in your engine schematic?**
///
