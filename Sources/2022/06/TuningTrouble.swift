/**
 Day 3: Tuning Trouble

 # Part One

 The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot
 and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.

 As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a
 handheld **device.** He says that it has many fancy features, but the most
 important one to set up right now is the **communication system.**

 However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with
 signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to
 give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem
 fixing it.

 As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

 To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to **lock on to
 their signal.** The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the
 device receives one at a time.

 To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device
 that detects a **start-of-packet marker** in the datastream. In the protocol
 being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence
 of **four characters that are all different.**

 The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input);
 your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most
 recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to
 report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of
 the first such four-character marker.

 For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

 `mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb`

 After the first three characters (`mjq`) have been received, there haven't
 been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a
 marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most
 recent four characters `mjqj`. Because `j` is repeated, this isn't a marker.

 The first time a marker appears is after the **seventh** character arrives.
 Once it does, the last four characters received are `jpqm`, which are all
 different.  In this case, your subroutine should report the value `7`, because
 the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have
 been processed.

 Here are a few more examples:

 * `bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz`      : first marker `p` after character `5`
     ....^
 * `nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg`      : first marker `t` after character `6`
      ....^
 * `nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg` : first marker `j` after character `10`
          ....^
 * `zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw`  : first marker `l` after character `11`
           ....^

 How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet
 marker is detected?


 # Part Two

 Your device's communication system is correctly detecting packets, but still
 isn't working. It looks like it also needs to look for **messages.**

 A **start-of-message marker** is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it
 consists of **14 distinct characters** rather than 4.

 Here are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the
 above examples:

 * `mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb`    : first marker after character `19`
 * `bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz`      : first marker after character `23`
 * `nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg`      : first marker after character `23`
 * `nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg` : first marker after character `29`
 * `zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw`  : first marker after character `26`

 How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message
 marker is detected?
